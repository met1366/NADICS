**NADICS** is an open source framework for the purpose of Network Anyomaly Detection for Industrial Control Systems using classical machine learning and neural networks methods. The software adapts to Scikit-learn and TensorFlow, while taking general datasets as input. This flexibility lets you easily analyze training and inference on a single CPU or multiple GPUs in a desktop or server without rewriting code.

NADICS was originally developed by researchers and engineers working at the chair of IT Security at the Technical University of Munich for the purpose of conducting network intelligence research. The system is general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other domains, as well.
